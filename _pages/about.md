### **About Me**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Preston Foshee, a full-stack web developer passionate about building modern web apps. JavaScript is my favorite language and Vue.js is my framework of choice. In addition to web development, I have experience in UX/UI Design from building prototypes for my personal projects as well as during my intership with Thunder Media Group during the summer of 2021.

I was born and raised in Tampa, FL and am currently attending the University of Central Florida in Orlando, where I will graduate in May of 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Web Design from the College of Sciences.
